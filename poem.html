        <h1>O Captain! My Captain!</h1> 
   <p> The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won, </p>
   </p> The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,</p>
    </p>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But O heart! heart! heart! <br />  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O the bleeding drops of red,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fallen cold and dead.<br /> </p>
    
  </p>  <b>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; </b> </p> 
</p>   Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,  </p> 
</p>  For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,  </p> 
</p>  For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;  </p> 
 <ul> <li> Here Captain! dear father!  <br /> </li>
    <li>This arm beneath your head!<br /> </li>
    <li>It is some dream that on the deck,<br /> </li>
    <li>You’ve fallen cold and dead.<br /> </li> </ul>
    
  <p>   <em>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still, </em> </p>
</p>  My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,</p>
</p> The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,</p>
</p>  From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;</p>
<ol> <li> Exult O shores, and ring O bells!<br />  </li>
    <li> But I with mournful tread,<br />  </li>
 <li>Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br /> </li>
<li>Fallen cold and dead.<br /> </li> </ol>
                                    </p>
