                This online exhibition showcases three websites that are solely dedicated to wasting time and causing frustration. It serves as a contrast to what we expect the internet to be. We expect the internet to be clean and efficient. If we want to find something we can search it on the internet and find it in seconds. These websites subvert that expectation by being intentionally useless or annoying. The websites, ranging from endless password requirements to simulated system failures, also tap into the psychological effects of technology and the digital landscape. Companies have developed algorithms to try and keep us as engaged as long as possible, whereas these sites do the opposite of that.

                <h2>Password Game</h2>
                <p><strong>Neal Agarwal</strong>, 2023</p>
                <p>This interactive web game requires users to create a password with increasingly absurd and impossible requirements, mocking the often frustrating and arbitrary password creation rules found on various sites.</p>

                <p><strong>Tim Holman</strong>, 2012</p>
                <p>The Useless Web directs users to a random, often pointless website, reinforcing the idea of the internet as a space filled with infinite distractions and content that serves no purpose other than to occupy time and attention.</p>

                <p><strong>soonintokyo</strong>, 2011</p>
                <p>This site simulates the experience of a computer restart, complete with old loading screens and system startup sounds, triggering the anxiety associated with potential system failures and harkening back to a bygone era.</p>
